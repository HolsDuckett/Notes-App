# Planning

```
As a programmer
I can create a new note
So I can record something I need to remember
```

html
---------
note box
create button

javascript
---------
record of notes
create note function --> note object


```
As a programmer
I can see a list of my notes, where each note is abbreviated to the first 20 characters
So I can find the one I want
```

html
--------
list of all created notes


javascript
----------
abbreviated notes (function on note object)

```
As a programmer
I can see the full text of an individual note on its own page
So I can see all the information in the note
```
html
--------
display note - button
hide note - button

javascript
----------
function to change the display to allow whole note
function to hide the note back to abbreviated 20 chars
